# Book-List-Razor-Pages

A book list application is still in a work in progress. 
I always make changes or add new things from time to time. 

Currently it has the following features.

It is built on dot net core 3.1
It is using the razor pages pattern
It has features like create,update, retreive a book or books.
Added a second table which is using datatables to display the books
Removed the create a new book page to a modal on the booklist page.
Http requests are used to handling crud operations.

Things that i have planed to add:

Remove edit page and use a modal instead to do the edit functionality.
